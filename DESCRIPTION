Description: Generates 3D network from two correlated objects with shared common factors. 
    Specifically, 'gen3DNet' builds the relationships between samples and shared factors using the 
    non-negative matrix factorization, where three clustering techniques are evaluated to determine 
    the number of functional modules. In addition, it builds the relationships between samples from 
    the two distinct data objects based on a partial least squares regression model.
